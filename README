Parse-Readelf version 0.03
==========================

Parse::Readelf is a module to parse the output of readelf from the GNU
binutils suite.  At the moment only small parts of the debugging
section are supported to get information about the structure layout of
the variables of a binary object.  Also only Dwarf-2 debugging
information is understood.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

As this module parses the output of readelf of course you need that.
objdump would work as well but as it's part of the same suite there is
no real reason to use it instead of readelf (at least for Dwarf-2, for
Stabs or other debugging formats there might be a difference).

The test-suite needs the Unix command "cat" to simulate a test run
with prepared output.

In addition you'll need gcc (g++) if you like to test the examples in
the "Examples" directory.

Other than that the example script "run_examples.pl" needs a shell
supporting I/O redirection.  If you don't have one, you probabely have
to try the examples by hand.

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Carp
  File::Spec
  Test::More

BUGS

This is quite incomplete yet.  I only worked on that what I needed
most which was the memory layout of variables and data types.

Feedback, additional debugger outputs or patches are very much appreciated.
